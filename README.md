# Weather-Dashboard

Our assignment this week was to create a weather dashboard. The main function of the weather dashboard is to be able to search any city in the world and have the current days weather displayed with the date, an image of the conditions, temperature, wind speed and humidity. Also displayed is the conditions for the next five days following. Another function of the application is to save the cities that have been searched, and when clicked, that cities weather is displayed, without having to type in the city in the search bar again.

My biggest struggle with this assignment was no figuring out why my saved searches weren't being displayed, as well as the UV index not showing up either. I've looked through the code, but I can not pinpoint where I've gone wrong.
