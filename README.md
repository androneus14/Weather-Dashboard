# Weather-Dashboard

Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

Use the OpenWeather One Call API to retrieve weather data for cities. Read through the documentation for setup and usage instructions. You will use localStorage to store any persistent data. For more information on how to work with the OpenWeather API, refer to the Full-Stack Blog on how to use API keys.

## User Story

    AS A traveler
    I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
    SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

## Acceptance Criteria

    GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
    WHEN I search for a city
    THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
    WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
    THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
    WHEN I view the UV index
    THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
    WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
    THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
